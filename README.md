# lunch_roulette

A Clojure library designed to  randomly generate lunch groups, sampling both people and
restaurants. One possible application is to sample groups to go have lunch at work, to
improve teams integration. Lunch roulette samples the groups from the following data:

- a list of people with their preferences and restrictions;
- a list of restaurants with some characteristics (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free)
- and a historical sampling, so it can avoid repeating people and restaurants.
